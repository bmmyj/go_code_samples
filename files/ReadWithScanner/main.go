// Scanner is part of the bufio package. It is useful for stepping through files at specific delimiters.
// Commonly, the newline character is used as the delimiter to break up a file by lines. In a CSV file,
// commas would be the delimiter. The os.File can be wrapped in a bufio.Scanner just like a buffered reader.
// We call Scan() to read up to the next delimiter, and then use Text() or Bytes() to get the data that was read.

//The delimiter is not just a simple byte or character. There is actually a special function you have to implement
// that will determine where the next delimiter is, how far forward to advance the pointer, and what data to return.
// If no custom SplitFunc is provided, it defaults to ScanLines which will split at every newline character.
// Other split functions included in bufio are ScanRunes, and ScanWords.

// In the next example, a bufio.Scanner is created from the file, and then we scan read the file word by word.
